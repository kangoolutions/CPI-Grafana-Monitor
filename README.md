# CPI-Grafana-Connect

Integrate your SAP Cloud Integration instance with Grafana Cloud Stack to enhance monitoring and alerting capabilities in SAP Cloud Integration (CPI).

## About the Project

This project aims to develop an enterprise-ready monitoring solution for SAP Cloud Integration (CPI). As the complexity increases, obtaining a clear overview becomes more challenging. Relying on custom solutions within integration flows may not be optimal for mission-critical applications. This project strives to elevate monitoring to a new level and to break free from conventional patterns. It is published as open source so everyone can participate.

To get this all working, logs and metrics are sent to Grafana Cloud to feed dashboards.
